      <h5><strong>ANNAPOLIS</strong> - Three years after state lawmakers celebrated the passage of the Maryland Police Accountability Act, the rollout of the new police oversight systems has proven slow, inconsistent and rife with disagreements about how to implement the new oversight process — challenges that frustrate critics and administrators alike.</h5>

      <br>

      <p>But the Maryland General Assembly has shown little appetite for revisiting the law, leaving many of the unresolved questions about the new police oversight systems in the hands of local governments.</p>

      <p>A Capital News Service review of misconduct complaint records, court hearings and interviews with key stakeholders revealed that roughly a quarter of Maryland jurisdictions did not get their police oversight systems up and running before the July 2022 deadline set by state lawmakers. The new oversight bodies in Baltimore City, along with Dorchester, Cecil and Kent Counties, did not meet until 2023, citing workload, administrative barriers and a shortage of qualified candidates.</p>

      <p>Even in jurisdictions that did meet the deadline, some administrators have struggled to navigate ambiguities in the law, including the basic definition of “police misconduct” and how to treat unfounded misconduct complaints. In one county, three people who submitted misconduct complaints later had to defend themselves in court against counter-accusations that they had submitted false reports and wasted police resources.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0670/?ys=2021RS" target="_blank">2021 Maryland Police Accountability Act</a> outlined a three-tiered police oversight system that theoretically overhauled the state’s long-standing rules for police misconduct investigations and gave civilian bodies the authority to receive misconduct complaints, review police internal investigations and issue discipline. The reforms were the most prominent contribution by Maryland lawmakers to a wave of police oversight reforms nationwide in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer a year earlier.</p>

      <p>Police Accountability Boards, or PABs, form the foundation of the new system. The boards are responsible for receiving civilian complaints and passing them to the appropriate law enforcement agency for an internal investigation. At the end of each year, state law requires the boards to produce a report on police disciplinary patterns each year. Those reports should, at least in theory, include “recommendations on changes to policy that would improve police accountability.”</p>

      <p>“They are an alternate intake for complaints about the police,” said Maryland House Majority Leader David Moon, D-Montgomery County. “That was done explicitly because of the concern that some raised about what message it sends … when the only place you can file a complaint about a police officer is with the department itself.”</p>

      <p>Moon, a member of the Maryland General Assembly’s <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/pubs-current/Final-Report-Police-Reform-Workgroup.pdf" target="_blank">police reform and accountability work group</a>, was a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/hogan-vetoes-police-accountibility/2021/04/09/c0ac4096-9967-11eb-962b-78c1d8228819_story.html" target="_blank">leading voice of support</a> for the Police Accountability Act in 2021 – an opportunity, he argued, to <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2021/04/10/maryland-legislators-pass-landmark-police-reform-package-into-law-overriding-gov-hogans-vetoes/" target="_blank"> “refresh” the state’s approach to policing </a> and remove some of the more onerous barriers civilians face when filing police misconduct complaints. </p>

      <p>But Moon, <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/05/17/after-committee-chairs-resignation-speaker-announces-shakeup-in-house-leadership/" target="_blank">who rose from vice-chair of the House Judiciary Committee</a> to House Majority Leader in 2023, also says state lawmakers generally expect local governments to be proactive in making the new police oversight systems work, though he doesn’t always endorse that approach.</p>

      <p>“If there are real issues, of course, the state can step in for clarification, but we are essentially still in the early stages of allowing the implementation to flow through local governments,” Moon said.</p>

      <p>Active-duty law enforcement cannot legally serve on the boards, but those restrictions do not apply to the <a href="https://www.stmaryscountymd.gov/docs/Police_Accountability_Board.pdf" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/2022/07/05/frederick-nominates-police-accountability-board-members/" target="_blank">retired law enforcement officers</a> <a href="https://www.howardcountymd.gov/News060822e" target="_blank">currently serving</a> on <a href="https://baytobaynews.com/stories/members-appointed-to-fill-somerset-countys-new-police-accountability-board,84580" target="_blank">PABs across the state. A CNS analysis shows that at least half of Maryland jurisdictions have appointed former law enforcement officers to their PABs – including, in some cases, as board chairs.</p>

      <p>During the drafting of the law in 2021, critics like the ACLU of Maryland argued that former law enforcement officers should also be barred from serving on PABs in the interest of neutrality.</p>

      <p>State lawmakers set an unenforced timeline for the creation of new county-level police oversight agencies: each jurisdiction, including Baltimore City, would establish a PAB by July 2022, and each PAB would release an annual report on its activities that year.</p>

      <p>Anne Arundel County was among the first to follow through on the directive, at least in part because the county executive’s office <a href="https://www.aacounty.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/PAB-2022-Annual-Report.pdf" target="_blank">received dozens of applications from qualified candidates for the eight-person board.</a> At the other end of the spectrum, a half-dozen counties struggled to stand up their PABs and to refer complaints for investigation before the deadline.</p>

      <p>Moon says that state lawmakers anticipated those setbacks, but opted to set a shorter timeline to establish the new oversight bodies rather than stalling the process on behalf of smaller jurisdictions. “We ultimately decided to force the implementation process along, even if there were delays and hiccups,” he said.</p>

      <p>In some counties, shortages of volunteers and limited training opportunities were behind the delays.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="large-6 medium-12 small-12">
      <p>In Dorchester Counties, which finally seated its PAB in early 2023, recruitment was a primary obstacle. Cecil County Attorney Lawrence Scott says that while his county did not encounter the same shortage of volunteers, the amount of preparation needed to launch Cecil County’s PAB likewise pushed the committee’s first meeting into 2023.</p>

      <p>In many counties, a lack of outreach and preparation meant that positions on the boards “often went to people who were already in the loop,” said Yanet Amanuel, the Director of Public Policy for the ACLU of Maryland.</p>

      <p>The PAB also appoints members of a jurisdiction’s new Administrative Charging Committee, which reviews police departments’ internal investigations and can increase – but not decrease – the penalties for an officer’s misconduct beyond their chief’s initial proposal. The third tier of the new system, known as the Trial Board, exists to hear appeals from officers facing discipline; a trial board’s decisions can, however, be appealed in circuit court.</p>

      <p>Kent County PAB liaison Pete Landon attributed his county’s delayed start in part to the absence of training opportunities for the members of the Administrative Charging Committee: a mandatory 40-hour course on police procedures.</p>

      <p>“When we got moving, (the) only training available was at the [Maryland Police and Correctional Training Center] in Sykesville,” Landon said. “If you’re in a place like Kent County, driving to Sykesville is almost a workday in and of itself … I don’t want to say that it makes it impossible, but it’s hard to tell someone volunteering that you have to attend that training mandatorily.”</p>

      <p>Those logistical barriers were compounded by the unexpected cancellation of some training sessions at the Sykesville center, Landon added.</p>

    <div class="large-12 medium-12 small-12">

      <p>While Allegany County was able to form a PAB in 2022, board chair Donald Knott noted that the training requirements for ACC members made it “very difficult to attract prospective members.” Those challenges left the county without a functioning ACC until May 2023.</p>

      <p>Those delays have come with consequences. Joshua Harris, the chair of Baltimore City’s PAB, says administrative red tape pushed back the board’s first meeting to February of last year, during which the city’s Office of Equity and Civil Rights accepted more than 300 complaints on the board’s behalf; the city did not form its ACC until July 2023.</p>

      <p>“[By the time of its first meeting], our ACC already had a backlog of cases,” Harris said. “If cases are not reviewed within a year and a day [after they are submitted], whatever the police department’s integrity bureau decides is basically final. That could mean there are problematic officers that remain on the streets.”</p>

    </div>
    <div class="large-6 medium-12 small-12">

      <p>Harris adds that the committee also continues to receive cases for review with little time to spare before the 366-day deadline, forcing them to rush their review or risk leaving the discipline to the discretion of the police department.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, county attorneys and PAB administrators elsewhere in the state have raised concerns that the rules for reviewing police misconduct and issuing discipline are riddled with ambiguities.</p>

      <p>The Worcester County State’s Attorney’s Office’s decision to bring criminal charges against three people whose police misconduct complaints were deemed to be unfounded offers a prime example.</p>

      <p> “The law does not currently provide protections for people who file complaints,” says Amanuel of the ACLU.</p>

      <p>Worcester County has charged three people — including  the first person to submit a complaint through the county’s PAB in 2022 — with filing a false report after submitting complaints about Ocean City police officers.</p>

      <p>The Ocean City District Court has yet to side with the State’s Attorney’s Office on the matter; judges dismissed all three cases, arguing that while the complaints themselves were unfounded, they did not rise to the level of criminality.</p>

      <p>“I have never seen a case where police bring a criminal charge against a person that wanted to be heard on their view of police conduct,” said Judge Richard Collins, who presided over the first trial, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24563671-oc-casepdf-1" target="_blank">during his closing remarks.</a> “I believe that it would have the effect of telling people, ‘don’t complain against the police because they might decide to make a criminal investigation of your differing opinions as to the conduct of these officers.”</p>

      <p>Messiah Burrell, a Pennsylvania resident and the second person to face charges after filing a misconduct report in Worcester County, believes his experience calls into question the value of the new oversight system itself.</p>

      <p>“I might have known what I was getting into,” he said. “I never got to talk to anyone on that [Police Accountability] Board. I only spoke with Ocean City Police.”</p>

      <br>
      <p>Moon, however, argues that Worcester County may be within its rights to penalize those who file unfounded complaints. “We want citizens to be able to file complaints simply and without too onerous a process,” he said. “But we want there to remain tight consequences for wholly fabricated claims. We don’t want to have a process where there’s no consequence for intentionally trying to lie and ruin someone’s life.”</p>

      <p>He adds that without a better grasp of the Worcester County cases, he does not know whether the county’s decision to prosecute complainants was appropriate. "It raises a lot of questions if Worcester creates a system that discourages complaints,” Moon said. “We don't want liars, but we also don't want people retaliated against for making complaints."</p>

      <p>The Worcester County State’s Attorney’s Office did not respond to inquiries about the cases.</p>

      <p>Worcester County Attorney Roscoe Leslie, however, identified other glaring ambiguities in the Maryland Police Accountability Act, including the definition of “police misconduct” itself.</p>

      <p>The law defines misconduct as “depriving persons of rights protected by the Constitution, violation of criminal statute and violation of law enforcement agency standards or policies.”</p>

      <p>“The way that it’s written leaves it open to the interpretation that you need all three – depriving persons of constitutional rights, violating criminal statutes and violating agency policy – to constitute misconduct,” Leslie argues. “I haven’t taken that interpretation, but it’s still possible.” The Prince George’s County PAB raised similar concerns, and the Maryland Attorney General’s office <a href="https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/wp-content/uploads/police-misconduct-letter-of-advice.pdf" target="_blank">stepped in last April</a> to clarify that counties should use the broader definition of police misconduct.</p>

      <p>Leslie also points out that the law doesn’t make clear who plays the role of prosecutor when an officer appeals a disciplinary decision. “If the [charging committee] recommends that an officer be fired and the officer objects, the law says they go before a trial board,” he says. “In the past, when an officer appealed a discipline, their department – which chose the discipline – would act as the prosecutor. But now, the committee sets the bar for discipline, so what happens when a police department that doesn’t want to fire the officer has to defend the decision to fire them?”</p>

      <p>Some counties have also raised concerns that law enforcement agencies aren’t currently obligated to tell their jurisdiction’s PAB when they receive misconduct complaints. Charles’ County’s PAB, for instance, received no complaints in 2022, and it did not document the multiple complaints sent to the county Sheriff’s Department in its year-end report.</p>

      <p>For Harris, the lack of oversight rules — local or state — for PAB budgets is also a point of concern. While the board received a budget of $2.3 million in 2023, it is controlled by the Office of Equity and Civil Rights, not the board itself. “I couldn’t tell you how the budget can be used,” Harris said. “For jurisdictions that have funded police accountability boards, we should be asking questions about how we ensure those funds are appropriately used for civilian oversight of law enforcement.”</p>

      <p>Several Maryland counties have budgeted to pay PAB members for time spent in meetings and conducting outreach; board members in Prince George’s County, for instance, are paid $60 an hour for their work, while board members in Carroll County receive a flat rate of $125 per meeting. Counties that cannot afford to add stipends to their budget have turned to state grants to help incentivize participation; without those grants, Kent County’s Landon says that many rural counties would face an “unfunded mandate.”</p>

      <p>Despite the varied concerns from administrators around the state, Moon says that the Maryland General Assembly is unlikely to make adjustments to the law in the near future. “The state is generally loath to start tweaking major omnibus bills unless there is a clear error or a critical omission,” he said.</p>

      <p>Lawmakers in Annapolis did, however, consider one proposed change to the new police oversight system this year: a bill introduced by Baltimore delegate Malcolm Ruff (D-41) that would have granted the boards subpoena powers to conduct investigations concurrently with law enforcement agencies’ internal reviews.</p>

      <p>Jim Gormley, a former member of Howard County’s PAB and a founder of the Howard County Police Accountability Task Force, argues that granting subpoena power would encourage boards to take a more active role in police oversight. At the moment, he said, most boards serve as a “mail box,” in part because of uncertainty about the extent of their role in recommending reforms.</p>

      <p>“The state law says the PABs should work to ‘improve matters of policing,’” Gormley said. “What does working to improve policing actually mean? It doesn't mean nothing, but until we have a statutory mandate to take an active role, we're going to have a lack of clarity, lack of energy, and lack of drive towards accountability.”</p>

      <p>The proposal isn’t entirely novel: Baltimore City’s Civilian Review Board, which predates the 2021 law, is able to exercise subpoena power in reviewing police misconduct cases. However, since the formation of the city’s PAB last year, the Civilian Review Board has atrophied members, and the city has yet to fill those vacancies; as of March, the board had only a single voting member.</p>

      <p>Law enforcement advocates, however, countered that the ACCs already have subpoena power — whether or not they use it — and that adding another investigative step would over-complicate an already convoluted process.</p>

      <p>Law enforcement advocates, however, countered that the ACCs already have subpoena power — whether or not they use it — and that adding another investigative step would over-complicate an already convoluted process.</p>

      <p>“Across the state, we're talking about hundreds of cases,” Maryland Fraternal Order of Police President Clyde Boatwright told the Maryland House Judiciary Committee. “We still have found the one case that says the internal investigation should have been done differently. How many bites on the apple do we need to have?”</p>

      <p>Ruff’s bill ultimately failed to advance beyond the state’s Judiciary Committee, ending consideration of changes to Maryland’s police accountability system this year.</p>

      <p>For administrators like Harris, the reluctance of state lawmakers to make adjustments and additions to the system is disheartening — and risky. “There are holes that really should be filled in a consistent way,” he said. “That is true for us in Baltimore, and it is especially the case for the smaller jurisdictions.”</p>

      <p>Kent County’s Landon echoed his counterpart in Baltimore. “Inattention to rectify[ing] some of the gray areas has made compliance prolonged and difficult,” he told CNS. “Kent County and our PAB remains committed to making policing accountable and transparent,  but [we] would enjoy some legislative housekeeping to do so more efficiently.”</p>

      <p>Without updates to the Maryland Police Accountability Act — or, in some counties, confidence to expand upon the state law independent of the General Assembly — Howard County’s Gormley says that those seeking to improve the new system are “a little bit stuck.”</p>

      <p>But Moon maintains that state lawmakers designed the Maryland Police Accountability Act to leave much of the decision-making to the state’s 23 counties and Baltimore City.</p>

      <p>During the drafting of the bill, “I think everybody accepted that a lot of the decisions would be made locally,” Moon said. “We were standing up a framework, and local governments would have to fill in the gaps.”</p>
